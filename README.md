# FullText Search MySQL

Full-text searching is performed using MATCH() AGAINST() syntax. MATCH() takes a comma-separated list that names the columns to be searched. AGAINST takes a string to search for, and an optional modifier that indicates what type of search to perform. The search string must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation.
